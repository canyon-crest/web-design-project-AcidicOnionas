    <h3>How I Got Into Technology</h3>
    
    <p><img src = "images/image2.png"></img>I’ve always been curious about how computers work and what really happens behind the screen. When I first learned about coding, I was amazed that simple lines of text could create something <a href = https://github.com/AcidicOnionas target = "_blank">interactive and useful</a>. That curiosity grew into a real interest in computer science. I love how programming combines logic and creativity, that you can build something completely new just by thinking through a problem in the right way.</p>
    <h3>What I’m Learning Now</h3>

    <p><img src = "images/image.png"></img>Right now, I’m exploring different parts of <a href = "https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank">technology,</a> like coding, cybersecurity, and AI. I enjoy challenging myself with new tools and figuring out how to make things work more efficiently. I like experimenting with small projects and learning from mistakes because that’s where real progress happens. Every time I solve a problem or finish a project, it gives me the confidence to try something even harder next time.
    </p>
    <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
    
    <p><img src = "images/image3.png"></img>In the future, I want to keep improving my coding skills and use technology to make a difference. I’m interested in building systems that help people, whether that’s apps that simplify daily tasks or projects that solve active <a href = "https://www.sgrlaw.com/ttl-articles/10-technology-challenges/" target="_blank">real-world problems.</a> My goal is to keep learning, creating, and growing as both a student and a developer. I believe that every new project is another step toward understanding what I can truly build.</p>
